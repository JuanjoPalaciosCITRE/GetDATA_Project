## Repository for project files in the Getting and Cleaning data Course Project

Repository consists of 4 files;

README.md		The current open file.
run_analysis.R		The R script which creates the tidy result dataset from the 				original downloaded and unzipped files.
tidyresultset.txt	The resulting final file, to check if necessary after script is 			run.
CODEBOOK.md		The codebook to understand the data within the result file.

## RUNNING THE SCRIPT

Download the file from the following link:

Unzip the file, it will create a directory named “UCI HAR Dataset”. Make that folder your working directory with setwd(), copy the script to the working directory and run the script. 
The result file will appear in the Working directory. You can use objects in the work area of RStudio for review if you wish.
